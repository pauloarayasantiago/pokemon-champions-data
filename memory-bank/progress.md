## In Progress
- Extracting full Mega Evolution data (all 59 megas, not just 23 with new abilities)

## Pending
- Build Claude agent knowledge base
- Test with team-building scenarios

## Known Issues
- Castform shows Normal/Fire because Serebii lists its form types together
- Lycanroc shows 6 abilities (combines all 3 form abilities)
- Training mechanics page has minimal content (just VP costs)
